This project analyzes crowd movement and density patterns to detect congestion zones that may lead to stampede situations. The system can assist in improving crowd management and public safety monitoring.

## Features
- Crowd density estimation from video input
- Detection of high-risk congestion zones
- Crowd flow analysis
- Optimized processing for real-time deployment scenarios

## Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV
- Machine Learning
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Applications
- Public event monitoring
- Crowd management systems
- Surveillance risk analysis

## Future Improvements
- Real-time deployment optimization
- Integration with alert systems
- Improved accuracy using deep learning models
